								<p> Above are a few screenshots of my capstone project. This project was a true journey and honor. I was a bit anxious because I have never created a app
								,But I ended up loving the process and the learning curve. The goal of this Project is to mobilize a pre-existing software from a company called
								"accutech". The company provides software that helps trust administrators and officers manage different accounts. We were given the most important
								features that were expected to be in the mobile version like creating tasks, activities, and displaying account information at a glace. Although my main focus was front-end work, I helped the team on the back-end as well.
								The screenshots show the login page as well as different page views. I am satisfied with the outcome of this project and look forward to more challenges. </p>
